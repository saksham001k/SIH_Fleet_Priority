"""Pinned benchmark scenarios.

WHY THESE ARE FIXED AND SEEDED
==============================
"A minimum 20% reduction in total task completion time compared to traditional
stop-and-wait" is not a measurable claim on its own. The speedup of any coordination
policy swings from roughly 5% to over 300% depending on map topology, robot density and
the task mix - so a number quoted without a pinned scenario means nothing, and can be
manufactured to order by choosing a friendly map.

Every scenario here therefore fixes the map, the start cells, the exact task stream and
the RNG seed. Route-policy comparisons use identical pre-assigned queues; when one of
the task-allocation policies is selected, the same queues are flattened and announced
so the selected allocator becomes the only allocation variable.

`open_floor_control` exists to keep us honest: a map with no chokepoints where every
policy should tie. If our policy "wins" there too, the harness is measuring something
other than coordination and the headline number is wrong.

FLEET SIZE
==========
The statement asks for "at least 3 AMRs". Three robots cannot test its own hypothesis:
the entire justification for decentralising is *scaling*, and congestion, cascading
deadlock and O(N^2) message load only appear somewhere north of 20. At N=3 a central
planner wins trivially, and three robots in three disjoint aisles satisfy both stated
success criteria while solving nothing. So the default is larger and `bench` sweeps
N upward until the curves separate - that sweep is the actual result.
