The simulation core and the benchmark have **no third-party dependencies** — stdlib
only, so a robot node drops onto a bare Raspberry Pi image with no build step.

## Real-AMR deployment boundary

`edge_node.py` is the process installed on each AMR's Raspberry Pi or Jetson. A
vendor-specific driver translates the commercial controller's Ethernet, CAN, serial, or
ROS interface into the checked JSON/UDP contract: SI-unit pose, velocity, battery,
clearances and anonymous detections flow into BIOS; velocity, turn-rate, and fail-safe
stop commands flow back to the vendor controller. The controller's certified safety
chain remains authoritative.

The deployment boundary is now executable end to end without buying an AMR first:

```bash
python deployment_acceptance.py --duration 20
```

That command launches one public `edge_node.py` subprocess per AMR, drives each through
its real sensor/actuator UDP sockets, exercises authenticated multicast, Auction V2,
wrong-key and replay rejection, and forces a sensor outage to verify a bounded stop and
recovery. It writes machine-readable evidence to
`artifacts/deployment/deployment-acceptance.json`. This is closed-loop
software-in-the-loop evidence, not a claim that a physical AMR or Raspberry Pi was
tested. Facility geometry and robot limits are supplied through
`config/site.example.json`; announcement-only WMS jobs use `config/tasks.example.json`.
See [`docs/18-REAL-AMR-INTEGRATION.md`](docs/18-REAL-AMR-INTEGRATION.md).

## Decentralized priority algorithm

The default route policy is `BIOS_PIBT.6`; the frozen peer allocator is `auction`, and
the released Auction V2 allocator is selectable as `auction_bundle`. BIOS 6 combines V5's
battery-aware priority/deadline cargo allocation with event-triggered communication,
bounded predictive hints and measured recovery escalation. Every AMR broadcasts a
frozen lexicographic priority plus its next-cell intent. On grid-like rack maps it
plans on a strongly connected one-way circulation graph and takes an expiring,
two-phase peer lease on every destination cell. This prevents head-on entry and restores
one-robot-per-cell ownership before a queue forms. Merge contenders use the same frozen
total order; no process assigns moves and the dashboard is a passive observer.

BIOS 6 adds short-horizon occupancy prediction, distributed congestion experience,
charger-aware dock choice, load-aware idle-lane clearing, bounded auction-churn backoff,
peer winner nomination after persistent split views and machine-derived decision
explanations. BIOS 5 remains selectable as the frozen release baseline. The BIOS 6
multi-seed safety, liveness, performance and multi-process gates are documented in
[`docs/BIOS_PIBT_6_PREDICTIVE_INTELLIGENCE.md`](docs/BIOS_PIBT_6_PREDICTIVE_INTELLIGENCE.md).

Maps that cannot be oriented without losing reachability use bounded directional task
waves, block leases, early mouth staging and PIBT. Local 50 Hz protective stopping
remains authoritative for every policy.

See [`docs/BIOS_PIBT_3_PROTOCOL.md`](docs/BIOS_PIBT_3_PROTOCOL.md) for the complete
allocation/traffic relationship, state machine, conditional liveness argument and
current benchmark evidence. V2 remains documented in
[`docs/BIOS_PIBT_2_PROTOCOL.md`](docs/BIOS_PIBT_2_PROTOCOL.md).
Version 1 remains documented in
[`docs/DECENTRALIZED_PRIORITY.md`](docs/DECENTRALIZED_PRIORITY.md).

## The position this project takes

The problem statement asks for a fully decentralised fleet and treats centralisation as
the flaw. That framing does not survive contact with how AMR fleets are actually built,
and a submission that repeats it back is arguing from a false model. The specific errors
are catalogued in [`docs/CRITIQUE.md`](docs/CRITIQUE.md); the short version:

- **"Centralised" is not "cloud."** Real fleets (Amazon Robotics, Locus, Geek+, 6 River,
  OTTO) run an on-prem fleet manager on the LAN at 1–5 ms. The latency argument only
  works against an architecture nobody deploys.
- **The latency numbers do not survive arithmetic.** At 1.2 m/s, 50 ms is 6 cm. Global
  routing runs at 0.1–1 Hz anyway. Localisation error causes warehouse collisions;
  network round-trip does not.
- **Peer-to-peer does not fix Wi-Fi dead zones.** In infrastructure mode the access
  point relays peer frames — same radio, same hole. `tests/test_core.py` tests exactly
  this. The fix is a different link layer (802.11s, Wi-Fi Direct, UWB), which the
  statement never mentions.
- **"Zero inter-robot collisions" is not a testable claim.** Absence over finitely many
  runs bounds a rate; it does not establish zero. And over an asynchronous lossy channel
  no protocol can guarantee agreement at all (Fischer–Lynch–Paterson).
- **N ≥ 3 cannot test the hypothesis.** The justification for decentralising is scaling;
  congestion and cascading deadlock appear north of 20 robots.

So this repository implements a **hierarchy**, and treats full decentralisation as a
*degraded mode* rather than a superior architecture:

| Layer | Rate | Where it runs | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **0 — Safety** | 50 Hz | Onboard, certified, **never network-dependent** | Protective stop. Sized by own speed *and* closing speed. Sees anything, including things that do not broadcast. |
| **1 — Local traffic** | 10 Hz | Onboard | Peer intents, block-level exclusion, deadlock breaking, give-way manoeuvres. |
| **2 — Global route** | 1 Hz | Fleet manager when reachable, P2P when not | Prioritised space-time A*. Optimal when the network is healthy. |

Under ISO 3691-4 / EN ISO 13849, protective stopping must be local, independent and
certified — it may not wait on a radio packet. **Messaging buys efficiency; it never
buys safety.** Layer 0 does not import the protocol module.

### The one design decision everything rests on

`AMRBrain.step(t, sensors, inbox) -> (actuation, outbox)` — **the agent does no I/O.**
Transport and world are injected. That single constraint buys three things at once:

1. The same brain runs as a real UDP process, so decentralisation is something a judge
   can packet-capture (`tcpdump -i any port 26123`), not something they have to take on
   trust.
2. The same brain runs headless against a seeded network model at hundreds of times
   realtime, which is the only way to get a collision *rate with a confidence interval*
   instead of an anecdote.
3. The same brain drops onto a Pi unmodified — the direct answer to the statement's
   contradiction between "must run on constrained edge hardware" and "deliver a
   simulation".

## Coordination policies

All policies are fields on one class, sharing one trajectory follower, one safety layer and
one physics interface — so any difference between them is caused by coordination and
nothing else. Separately tuned controllers would make the comparison meaningless.

| Policy | What it is | Why it is here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stop_and_wait` | Textbook: follow your own shortest path, stop when the next cell is occupied. | The weak baseline the statement names. Implemented faithfully, not as a straw man. |
| `central` | Fleet manager plans everything with prioritised space-time A*. Robots follow the schedule; no peer negotiation. | **The strong baseline the statement omits** — what every deployed fleet actually runs. Beating only stop-and-wait proves nothing. |
| `hierarchical` | Central plans when reachable, P2P negotiation when not, Layer 0 always. | The proposal. Full decentralisation as a fallback, not an ideal. |
| `BIOS_1.0.0` | Decentralized block leases plus an aggressive local unstick manoeuvre. | Existing experimental liveness policy retained for comparison. |
| `BIOS_PIBT.1` | Replicated PIBT next-cell resolution, rich priorities and corridor leases. | Retained regression baseline; it gridlocks under the 24-AMR stress seed. |
| `BIOS_PIBT.2` | Strongly connected directed routes, two-phase destination-cell leases, merge priority and route-discontinuity repair. | V3 traffic foundation and retained benchmark. |
| `BIOS_PIBT.3` | V2 traffic plus replicated batch auction, drop admission, bounded directional waves, completion gossip and invariant repair. | Retained decentralized comparison policy. |
| `BIOS_PIBT.5` | V3 invariants plus full-commitment energy admission, payload/cargo factors, priority/deadline ordering, a live three-robot candidate set, bounded bid bundles and charging re-entry. | Frozen decentralized release baseline. |
| `BIOS_PIBT.6` | V5 plus event-triggered traffic, decaying peer congestion experience, soft anonymous-moving-object forecasts, charger contention avoidance, load-aware idle clearing, churn recovery and decision traces. | Default fully decentralized route policy; supports frozen Auction and released Auction V2 allocation. |

Task ownership is selected independently of the route policy. `auction` lets peers
broadcast bids and converge on deterministic leased awards; this is the fully
decentralized V3 mode. `hungarian` lets the optional fleet manager minimise the
robot-to-task cost matrix and exists only as a comparison baseline. Keeping allocation
and traffic separate makes their performance effects measurable rather than conflated.

`auction_bundle` is the released BIOS 6 Auction V2 control. It keeps the WMS announcement-
only, permits at most one version-bound future reservation per working robot, revalidates
energy, deadline, ownership, and path feasibility before promotion, and falls back to
idle-only auction behavior under loss, dead zones, incomplete peer views, or invalid
ownership. Completion facts are generation-bound, authenticated, persisted atomically at
the edge, and cannot resurrect a completed generation after a retry or restart.

```bash
python main.py --scenario showcase_open_floor --policy BIOS_PIBT.6 \
  --allocation-policy auction_bundle --robots 5 --seed 0
```

The BIOS 5 energy and cargo model is specified in
[`docs/BIOS_PIBT_5_ENERGY_AUCTION.md`](docs/BIOS_PIBT_5_ENERGY_AUCTION.md). Its refined
eight-seed energy-stress result improves completion from 7/8 to 8/8 while reducing
aggregate auction bids by 47.20% and total messages by 24.64%. Its separate SIH release
gate passes 90/90 candidate runs across 4-, 6-, and 8-robot fleets.

`--seeds N` pools runs so the safety statistics have enough exposure to mean something.

---

### `BIOS_4` — the learned one

A 549-parameter network chooses among five verbs the fleet already implements — proceed,
hold, yield to a passing bay, respect the block token, replan — at the 10 Hz traffic
layer. **It does not drive the wheels**, and that is deliberate: `_safety()` has final
authority over actuation, so a model trained to emit velocities would spend its capacity
rediscovering an envelope it is not allowed to leave, and sim-to-real would become a
question about chassis dynamics instead of about decisions.

Everything that must hold regardless of what the network learned stays in ordinary Python:
panic-on-stick fires above the model on its own timer, Layer 0 sits below it, and
unexecutable verbs are masked. A badly trained BIOS_4 is slow, not unsafe.

```bash
# train (about 45 minutes on 12 cores, writes models/bios4.json)
python -m src.evolve --population 24 --generations 30 --workers 12

# report it against every baseline on the HELD-OUT seeds
python -m src.evolve --evaluate models/bios4.json --workers 12
```

Or do both from the dashboard: pick `BIOS_4` and the Train / Upload buttons appear.
Training runs as a background job you can watch and cancel; the model downloads as a
`.json` you can re-upload here or flash onto a robot.

Training seeds (0–7) and evaluation seeds (8–11) are disjoint and the trainer refuses to
cross the line — training and reporting on the same seed turns the headline into a
memorisation score. Result and caveats: `docs/FINDINGS.md`.

## Status — read this before quoting any number

BIOS 6 Auction V2 passes its checked-in deterministic release campaign: **210/210 runs**
and **1,680/1,680 tasks** across 30 open-burst seeds, four packet-loss levels (0%, 5%,
10%, 20%), partition healing, and crashed-winner reassignment. The campaign observes
zero robot/robot, robot/human, and robot/rack contacts, zero detected deadlocks, zero hard-
deadline misses, and zero rejected completion proofs. Semantic results match under
`PYTHONHASHSEED` 0, 1, and 42. This is finite simulation evidence, not universal
completion, physical safety certification, or Byzantine security.

Against untouched BIOS 6 commit `a7753c6` on the identical 30-seed, 5-robot, 15-task
open-burst campaign, ordinary `auction` completes 438/450 tasks and 25/30 runs; Auction V2
completes 450/450 and 30/30. On the 25 seeds where both finish, the median paired makespan
delta is -14.6 s. Auction V2 sends 19.69% fewer messages, 8.89% fewer bytes, and records
15.30% fewer nonproductive wait ticks, while sending 31.68% more bid messages to evaluate
bounded future work. See
[`docs/BIOS6_AUCTION_V2_RELEASE.md`](docs/BIOS6_AUCTION_V2_RELEASE.md) and the checked-in
JSON evidence for the exact gates and limitations.

The strict SIH acceptance benchmark now passes all 90 paired seeds across 4-, 6- and
8-robot fleets with the released default stack: `BIOS_PIBT.6` plus Auction V2
(`auction_bundle`). The candidate completes 30/30 runs at every fleet size; stop-and-wait
completes 0/30 before the fixed 1200 s cutoff. The minimum conservative per-seed
completion-time reduction bounds are **65.22%**, **50.63%** and **33.46%** respectively,
all above the required 20%. All 1,620 candidate tasks complete with zero observed contacts
and zero detected deadlocks across 88.3926 candidate robot-hours.

The same clean commit was also re-run with `BIOS_PIBT.5` plus plain `auction`. BIOS 6 with
Auction V2 preserves completion and safety, slightly improves the worst-case acceptance
bounds at 4 and 8 robots, and sends **18.0% fewer messages overall** across the 90 candidate
runs. It is not materially faster at the median on this pinned chokepoint workload; the
measured improvement is chiefly communication efficiency with no liveness or safety loss.

These are right-censored lower bounds, not exact speedups: the baseline makespans are
unknown because the baseline never finishes. A candidate result at time `C` and an
unfinished baseline at cutoff `D` establish only that the true reduction is greater
than `1 - C/D`. The release gate uses the minimum bound across seeds, not a favorable
average, and refuses candidate timeouts or mismatched workload fingerprints.

See [`docs/12-BENCHMARK-AND-EVIDENCE.md`](docs/12-BENCHMARK-AND-EVIDENCE.md) for the exact
method, limitations and commands. Raw evidence is checked in as
[`artifacts/benchmarks/sih-acceptance.json`](artifacts/benchmarks/sih-acceptance.json)
and [`artifacts/benchmarks/sih-acceptance.csv`](artifacts/benchmarks/sih-acceptance.csv),
with dated BIOS 6/V2 and BIOS 5 control artifacts beside them.
The complete Python regression suite, lint, Python compilation and frontend JavaScript
syntax checks are release gates; run them again before quoting a new commit as evidence.

## The dashboard

`python -m backend.server` then open <http://127.0.0.1:8000>. The default experience is
an interactive 3D warehouse digital twin with orbit, tactical, selected-AMR follow and
robot-POV cameras. Click an AMR to inspect battery reserve, cargo, task, deadline and P2P
neighbours; use **Jury Mode** for a clean, automatically narrated full-screen playback.
A dedicated operations dock below the scene holds camera, playback and selected-AMR
telemetry, so no robot card or transport control covers the warehouse. A 2D diagnostic
view remains available for protocol inspection.

When `BIOS_PIBT.6` is selected, the side rail adds a **Collective Intelligence** panel.
It reports measured packet suppressions, forecasts and reroutes, then replays bounded
decision records produced by the controller itself. The text is not generated after the
run and does not claim that the AMRs use an LLM.

The public demo library is deliberately limited to five explainable stories: Open Floor,
Chokepoint, Human Interaction, Dead-Zone Mesh and Grand Challenge. The dashboard arms and
auto-runs **Chokepoint** on load, not the first entry - Open Floor has no racks, so opening
on it shows a flat plane and four robots crossing it, which is the least of what the
simulation can do. One constant, `OPENING_SCENARIO` in `frontend/js/main.js`, decides this;
the library keeps its own order and numbering. The benchmark and
regression scenarios still exist in the simulation core, but are not mixed into the jury
UI. Every showcase defaults to the decentralized `auction` allocator, heterogeneous
battery state and cargo-aware energy admission. A WMS injects tasks; it never selects a
winner. Each AMR admits a bid only when the task, cargo factor and post-task charger return
remain above the protected reserve.

Grand Challenge now defaults to 10 AMRs, five mapped workers and 20 tasks. Its coloured
cargo is rendered on the adjacent blocked rack cell instead of on the pickup travel cell,
so the floor remains visually and physically readable. The checked five-seed acceptance
gate completes 100/100 tasks with zero observed robot-robot, robot-human or robot-rack
contacts; see [`docs/HUMAN_FLOW_AUDIT.md`](docs/HUMAN_FLOW_AUDIT.md) for the exact boundary
and per-seed results.

For a short traffic-coordination proof, enter **99** in the dashboard Seed field. The UI
arms a pinned six-AMR, 180 s launch-gridlock workload without adding a sixth gallery card.
All six tasks begin under their local chassis and cross the same occupied junction, so the
peer auction chooses local winners and the BIOS traffic layer—not an animation script—must
release the standstill. The dashboard reports the measured blocked-agent peak and first-
release latency. On the checked BIOS 6 run, 6/6 agents are blocked at 0.72 s, the first is
released 0.50 s later, and 6/6 tasks finish at 106.22 s with zero observed contacts. The
identical stop-and-wait workload completes 0/6 by 180 s. Exact scope, commands, and the
important distinction between prevention and the stale-cycle counter are in
[`docs/SEED_99_CONGESTION_DEMO.md`](docs/SEED_99_CONGESTION_DEMO.md).

The previous checked-in acceptance campaign remains BIOS 5 versus stop-and-wait evidence;
it must not be relabelled as BIOS 6 evidence. The final BIOS 6 three-seed showcase matrix
records zero observed robot/robot, robot/human and robot/rack contacts in 10.019 candidate
robot-hours. Open Floor and Human Interaction retain exact per-seed makespan parity while
cutting messages by 38.4% and 32.7%. BIOS 6 completes all 24 Chokepoint tasks versus
V5's 22, and all 18 Dead-Zone tasks versus V5's 16. In Grand Challenge fixed windows it
completes 47 tasks versus 27 (+74.1%), cuts waits by 58.4% and messages by 33.8%, with no
per-seed task-count regression. These are simulation observations, not physical safety
certification or a universal speedup claim. Exact evidence and limitations are in
[`docs/BIOS_PIBT_6_PREDICTIVE_INTELLIGENCE.md`](docs/BIOS_PIBT_6_PREDICTIVE_INTELLIGENCE.md).

Pick a showcase, route policy, task-allocation policy, fleet size and seed; the server
runs the simulation and returns the map, every telemetry frame and the result summary,
and the page plays it back with a scrubber. Three.js and OrbitControls are vendored under
`frontend/vendor/`, so the demo does not depend on venue Wi-Fi or a CDN.

It draws the things that are otherwise invisible, because a warehouse of moving robots
looks the same whether it is coordinating or getting lucky:

- **broadcast intent** — the cell horizon each robot publishes in its INTENT message,
  fading along the horizon as the time windows do
- **peer links** — who can currently hear whom, straight from each robot's peer table
- **wait-for arrows** — who is blocked on whom. Two arrows pointing at each other *is*
  the cycle the distributed deadlock detector searches for
- **single-file blocks** — the runs of aisle the traffic layer applies block control to
- **task allocation** — `TASK_NEW`, `BID`, `AWARD` and `TASK_DONE` messages for the
  peer auction, or directed manager awards for Hungarian allocation
- **mapped human workers** — three in Human Interaction and five in Grand Challenge,
  assigned to seeded two-aisle rack work zones across the complete warehouse. Workers
  walk mapped A* routes, pause for shelf inspections, side-step or reverse under local
  reciprocal avoidance, and show explicit walking/working/yielding state. They publish
  nothing and never participate in fleet negotiation; every AMR detects them through
  its independent onboard safety model

The run endpoint is POST-only, size- and workload-bounded, and protected by strict
request validation and browser security headers. Playback rather than a live socket:
the sim runs far faster than realtime, so streaming
would mean throttling it back to wall-clock for no benefit, and a recorded run can be
paused on the frame where two robots negotiate a chokepoint and replayed against a
different policy on the same seed.

## Real edge processes and failure campaigns

`python edge_demo.py --robots 3 --duration 5` starts a distinct operating-system process,
brain, clock epoch, replay window and authenticated multicast socket for every AMR. The
parent is a physics/lidar referee only; it never forwards peer traffic or chooses routes,
bids, priorities or motor commands. `edge_node.py` replaces that referee pipe with a
validated UDP sensor/actuator bridge and fails safe when sensor frames are invalid or
stale.

`python fault_campaign.py --seeds 30 --jobs 8` is a separate release gate covering
0/5/10/20% packet loss, partition and healing, and crash of the current auction winner.
The lease expiry reopens work for surviving robots; a failed chassis remains a sensed
physical obstacle. Dynamic anonymous obstacles are promoted to expiring local blocked
cells only after persistent observations, then routes are recalculated.

See [`docs/EDGE_DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/EDGE_DEPLOYMENT.md) for clean-clone/venv commands,
[`docs/WIRE_PROTOCOL.md`](docs/WIRE_PROTOCOL.md) for the validated packet contract and
[`docs/DEMO_AND_JUDGING.md`](docs/DEMO_AND_JUDGING.md) for the live judging sequence.
The deployment runbook also covers the Raspberry Pi service.
Actual Pi/Jetson CPU and memory claims still require running the included harness on that
named device; local Mac timing is intentionally not presented as Pi evidence.
